## tiny-es6-calc
### Brief Introduction

This is a calculator based on best practices of using ES6 modules.
It shows imports and exports.
Equally we use get elemnet by id because it returns an Element object representing the element whose id property matches the specified string.
As opposed to queryselctor which returns the first element that is a descendant of the element on which it is invoked that matches the specified group of selectors.
This calculator is a challenge from Maye Edwin's article on Writing JavaScript ES6 Modules.
